## Local development

1. Create a new repository based on the `helix-project-boilerplate` template and add a mountpoint in the `fstab.yaml`
1. Add the [helix-bot](https://github.com/apps/helix-bot) to the repository
1. Install the [Helix CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `npm install -g @adobe/helix-cli`
1. Start Franklin Proxy: `hlx up` (opens your browser at `http://localhost:3000`)
1. Open the `{repo}` directory in your favorite IDE and start coding :)

## Sitemap
The sitemap.xml is generated by gathering the content of two indexes though the helix-sitemap.yaml:

the static index
the products index
The static index is directly managed by Franklin upon publication and unpublication of pages.

The Products index is managed through a GitHub action, that will trigger the reindexing of the product pages it will gather the products from querying Commerce GraphQL. The product index is run daily or through a manual execution.

To be able to remove products pages from the sitemap:

The /query-index.xlsx should be emptied
The sync-commerce GitHub Action should be executed, this will ensure that only product currently available will be added
